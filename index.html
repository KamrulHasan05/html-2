		<p><i>Islamic  history </i> has  seen  many  empires  and  dynasties  rise  and  fall,  beginning  with  some  prominent empires  like  Umyyas,  Abbasids,  Mamluk,  Mughal,  and  the  Ottoman  empire.  Nevertheless, the  Ottoman empire  was  raised  as  an exemption  and  lasted  much  longer,  from  its  transformation  in  the  late <em>13th-century  and  its  collapse  in  the early  20th  century.</em> The  decline  of  the  ottoman  empire  started  after  the death  of  the  Sultan  Suleiman  the magnificent.  Under  the  Suliemanâ€™s  rules,  the  Ottoman  empire  reached prominence:<b>socially,  politically,  economically.</b>  As  a  result,  Sulieman  stood  at  the peak of  two  worlds, that of  Ottoman  triumph  and  gradual  decline. Therefore,  this  essay  will  discuss <strong> the  socio-political  and economic factors, both internal and  external,</strong>that led   to   the   fall   of   the   ottoman   empire. </p>
